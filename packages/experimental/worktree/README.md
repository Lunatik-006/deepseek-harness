English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Create an isolated checkout from a pinned commit and continue the same Session in it. Each operation creates a new named branch and leaves the source checkout intact. Model-requested creation keeps the Session sandbox; automatic new-Session setup can explicitly use trusted host access. Leaving the checkout retains its files and branch.

## Use this package

Mount the service alongside `workingDirectory`, `fs`, `subprocess`, `sandbox`, `sandboxPolicy`, and `systemPrompt` providers. Add the tool package when models need the operation.

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-worktree'
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-worktree'
```

For every new top-level Git-backed Session to enter a fresh checkout before its first prompt, configure the service after the working-directory provider:

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-worktree'
  config:
    newSession: true
    directory: .dsh/worktrees
    freshBase:
      remote: origin
      branch: main
    bootstrapSandbox: session
```

`freshBase` requires a successful fetch on every creation, serializes fetch and commit pinning for a shared Git directory, and rejects `from` overrides. A failed fetch stops preparation before a branch or checkout is allocated; cached refs and local `HEAD` are never substituted. `newSession` requires `freshBase`. Empty Sessions remain immediately available; the first prompt waits for setup before instruction assembly continues, and no model request starts after a failed setup. Non-Git chats, resumes, seeded Sessions, and subagents keep their existing directory. The original Session header and sandbox root remain unchanged while the working-directory service records the new checkout.

The configured pool is provider-owned for automatic Session setup: a missing pool `.gitignore` is created exclusively with `*` and a newline, so it ignores itself and every checkout. Existing ignore files are preserved. Bootstrap checks that the destination is ignored before Git creates the worktree, and stops if existing rules expose it in the source checkout. This keeps the source checkout status unchanged without editing its tracked ignore files, Git configuration, or exclude list.

`bootstrapSandbox: host` explicitly authorizes the service's fixed automatic new-Session Git and directory setup outside the agent sandbox, including repository Git hooks, checkout filters, transport, and credential helpers. Choose it only for a trusted repository when its setup needs host access. This path uses normal Git checkout and preserves its hooks and filters. The default `session` keeps setup confined; model-requested `create_worktree` and `restore` always keep the calling Session's sandbox regardless of this setting. No arbitrary model shell command can select host bootstrap. Neither mode removes existing worktrees or discards their changes.

`ctx.worktrees.create(agent, { name?, from? }, signal?, onPhase?)` creates a new branch and checkout, then enters the canonical checkout directory through `ctx.workingDirectory.set`. `from` resolves to a local commit before creation and defaults to `HEAD` when `freshBase` is absent; staged, unstaged, untracked, and ignored source files are not copied. `baseCommit` reports the resolved commit object name; repository-local replacement refs still apply to the checked-out content. Checkout disables configured Git clean, smudge, and process filters without changing repository configuration. An existing branch or checkout path is an error. The returned record contains `path`, `branch`, `baseCommit`, and `repositoryRoot`. An optional fourth argument, `onPhase`, receives `prepare` before validation, directory allocation, and branch creation, and `checkout` before the files are written and the checkout is entered; it must not throw.

`ctx.worktrees.restore(agent, { path, branch, baseCommit, repositoryRoot }, signal?, onPhase?)` checks a removed worktree out again at its recorded directory. It validates the recorded repository root, full commit object name, branch, and canonical target inside the configured pool before mutation. It removes only the missing target's unlocked registration with `git worktree remove`; other worktrees and locked registrations remain unchanged. It then checks out the branch when it still exists, or creates the branch again at `baseCommit` when it does not, and reports which happened as `branchRecreated`. An existing directory is an error. The calling Session's working directory does not change, and changes that were never committed are not recovered. Checkout disables filters as creation does. `onPhase` receives `prepare` before validation, target-registration cleanup, and branch creation, and `checkout` before the files are written; it must not throw.

The default checkout directory is `<current checkout root>/.agents/worktrees/<name>`. The returned `repositoryRoot` is the top-level directory of the caller’s current checkout; when it is a linked checkout, the pool is nested inside it. Omitted names join the `dsh-` prefix, the first eight hexadecimal digits of the UUID in the Session id, a hyphen, and four random hexadecimal digits, such as `dsh-6b1f02c4-9a3e`; a Session id without a UUID gets eight random hexadecimal digits after the prefix. `generatedWorktreeName` exports the same rule for callers that name a worktree before creating it. The service writes a `.gitignore` containing `*` and a trailing newline only when its allocation creates the pool; existing files and ignore rules are preserved. Relative `directory`, generated `namePrefix`, executable choices, and process limits are configurable in the [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-experimental-worktree).

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

Git and directory allocation run through the mounted subprocess provider. Model-requested operations and default bootstrap use the calling Session's existing sandbox policy; explicit host bootstrap applies only to automatic first-prompt preparation. Directory creation claims the destination exclusively; cancellation and failed setup can leave retained artifacts, whose path appears in the error. Service disposal aborts pending operations and waits for their settlement.

| Source | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Resolve the source revision, create the checkout, and publish the new working directory |
| [`src/process.ts`](src/process.ts) | Confine literal argv, cap output, and await process termination |
| [`src/directory.ts`](src/directory.ts) | Claim the destination and initialize a newly created pool's ignore file |

No runtime invariant companion is published: Git owns checkout registration and the working-directory service owns the Session directory; this package retains no independent projection of either.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the worktree tool's creation result and the working-directory service's recorded Session context.

#### KV Cache effect

This package contributes no prompt text. Its consumers own the appended tool result and recorded directory context.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Retained artifacts** — leaving a worktree keeps its branch and files. Setup failures can also retain partial artifacts; checkout removal and branch deletion belong to the user or another consumer.
- **Checkout setup** — without `freshBase`, creation uses local commits only. The service does not initialize submodules, install dependencies, or copy uncommitted or ignored files. Confined checkout also does not fetch missing partial-clone objects; on Git that meets the execution requirements, missing local objects cause creation to fail.
- **Filtered representations** — confined checkout skips configured filters to avoid executing repository-configured programs or triggering implicit downloads. Git LFS pointers and encrypted blobs stay in their stored representation; hydration or decryption is a separate user-controlled operation. Explicit host bootstrap preserves ordinary checkout filters.
- **Execution requirements** — the subprocess provider must offer Git and Node in the same execution world as the filesystem provider. Git must honor `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH`, which Git 2.45 and the 2.39.4, 2.40.2, 2.41.1, 2.42.2, 2.43.4, and 2.44.1 maintenance releases do; older releases ignore it and proceed instead of failing, so creation can fetch missing partial-clone objects from a promisor remote. The `git --no-lazy-fetch` option would reject these releases, but it exists only in Git 2.45 and later and also rejects the patched maintenance releases. The existing sandbox must permit all checkout and shared Git metadata writes.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

The sandboxed Node child supplies exclusive directory creation, which the [filesystem service](../../fs/fs/src/index.ts) does not expose, and identifies whether this service created the pool. The filesystem contract permits bare providers such as [fs-local](../../fs/fs-local/src/index.ts) to ignore `sandboxPolicy` on writes; `createIfAbsent` protects a file but neither enforces permissions nor identifies who created its directory. Keeping directory allocation and ignore-file creation under the same process sandbox as Git preserves refusal of existing checkout paths and the condition for creating `.gitignore`.
